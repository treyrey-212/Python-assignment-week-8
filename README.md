COVID-19 Vaccination and Cases Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes a COVID-19 dataset containing information on global cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The primary goal was to explore trends in vaccination rollouts and case numbers across countries, visualize the data, and uncover key insights. Several visualizations, including line charts, world maps, and bar charts, were created to identify patterns and anomalies in vaccination rates and COVID-19 statistics.

Data Overview
Dataset Source: The dataset was sourced from Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset.

Key Variables:

location: Country name

date: Date of the recorded data point

total_cases: Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases

total_deaths: Cumulative number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19

total_vaccinations: Total number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered

population: Country population

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Loading and Filtering: The data was loaded using Pandas and filtered for countries of interest, including Kenya, USA, and India.

Handling Missing Data: Rows with missing or invalid dates, critical values like total cases, or vaccinations were dropped. Missing values were filled using forward fill where appropriate.

Date Conversion: The date column was converted to datetime format for easier time series analysis.

Numeric Data Handling: Missing numeric values were either filled or interpolated.

Analysis & Visualizations
Vaccination Rollout Analysis:

Visualized the cumulative number of vaccinations over time for selected countries (e.g., USA, Kenya, India).

Compared vaccination percentages across countries using pie charts and world maps.

Identified countries with the fastest and slowest vaccine rollouts.

Case and Death Analysis:

Plotted the total number of cases and deaths over time for various countries.

Compared daily new cases and deaths between countries.

Analyzed the relationship between total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

Country Comparisons:

Compared vaccination rates across countries, highlighting countries with high vaccination rates (e.g., Israel, UK) and those with low rates (e.g., some African nations).

Investigated anomalies in vaccination data (e.g., countries reporting more vaccinated individuals than their population).

Geospatial Visualization:

Created world maps to visualize vaccination rates by country, showing disparities in vaccination efforts globally.

Used GeoPandas for static maps and Plotly for interactive choropleth maps.

Key Insights
Fast Vaccine Rollouts:

Countries like the USA, Israel, and the UK had rapid vaccine rollouts, achieving high vaccination rates in a short time.

Slow Vaccine Rollouts:

Some countries, particularly in Africa (e.g., Kenya, Nigeria), had much slower vaccine rollouts, potentially due to logistical challenges or limited access to vaccines.

Correlation Between Vaccination and Case Numbers:

Countries with higher vaccination rates saw a noticeable reduction in case numbers over time, suggesting that vaccines helped control outbreaks.

Data Anomalies:

Some countries reported more vaccinated individuals than their total population, highlighting issues with data accuracy or reporting inconsistencies.

Vaccination Rollout and Population Density:

Smaller countries or those with higher population densities (e.g., Israel, UAE) had higher vaccination rates, likely due to more effective distribution networks and logistical advantages.

Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the global trends of COVID-19 vaccinations and case numbers. It highlights the disparities in vaccination efforts across different regions and offers insights into the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 outcomes. Visualizations such as line charts, world maps, and pie charts were key in presenting these findings.

The project also identified and addressed anomalies in the data, ensuring that only valid and reliable information was used for the analysis.
